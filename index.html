        <p class="lead mb-4">The 20th century was the start of a century full of numerous events to report. Within the first two decades, major events occurred that ended up leading to a grand war. The major event that started World War I was the assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand, on June 28th, 1914. The growing hostility between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, the country where the assassin, Gavrilo Princip, was from, would soon see an increase in tensions between them. The news of the assassination would eventually spread throughout the United States through many local newspaper publishers.
                          	 In Professor Levy’s podcast “2.1 Hist20: 1900-1919”, she briefly explains how Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia after Serbian nationalists assassinated the Archduke of Austria-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand. The reason that these nationalists wanted to assassinate Franz Ferdinand may have been due to the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Austria-Hungarian Empire in 1908, according to a video by Salmon Khan titled “Assassination of Franz Ferdinand.” In the video, Khan explains how Austria-Hungary had already been settled in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the late 19th century, but in the early 20th century they decided to officially annex Bosnia and Herzegovina. This annexation prevented Serbia from uniting all Yugoslavs and fueled a national movement within the Kingdom of Serbia (Khan). In fact, when the assassin, Gavrilo Princip, was arrested, he stated that he was a Yugoslav nationalist who sought to unite all Yugoslavs and that they must be free from Austria-Hungary’s control (Khan). This was the event that influenced the assassination of Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914.  
                             The news of Franz Ferdinand’s death was quickly known throughout the United States by many newspaper publishers. The Day Book is one of the newspaper publishers that reported Ferdinand’s death. The Day Book is a local, advertisement-free newspaper publishing that is distributed throughout Cook County, the largest county in Illinois. The newspaper article published on June 29th, 1914 by The Day Book titled, “Heir to Austrian Throne and Wife Assassinated,” is an eyewitness account of the events that occurred in Sarajevo when Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated. The article reports that Ferdinand and his wife were visiting Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to attend a reception at the town hall. However, a bomb had gone off near the carriage that Ferdinand and his wife were riding. A few military officers were injured as a result, and Ferdinand planned to go to the hospital to visit the injured officers. On the way to the hospital, however, Ferdinand’s carriage came into contact with Gavrilo Princip, the Serbian assassin, where he then shot two bullets that ended up killing Ferdinand and his wife (The Day Book).  
                             The newspaper article tries to make its readers picture the event as if they were there by including very small and descriptive details about the event. For example, the publisher of the article described the two bullets that Princip shot in more detail by saying that “One struck the duchess in the side, the other struck the Archduke, severing the jugular vein” (The Day Book). This is the publisher’s way of keeping people engaged and interested in their articles since it makes the scene seem more dramatic than it may have been. The United States also doesn’t have close ties to Austria-Hungary, therefore, it makes sense that the publishers of the newspaper exaggerate some aspects of the events to improve appeal and ratings.
